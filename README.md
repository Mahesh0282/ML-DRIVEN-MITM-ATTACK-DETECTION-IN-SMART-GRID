# ML-DRIVEN-MITM-ATTACK-DETECTION-IN-SMART-GRID
Project Overview

This project focuses on detecting Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks in Smart Grid systems using Machine Learning (ML). It addresses vulnerabilities in the Modbus protocol, particularly to ARP spoofing, by evaluating seven ML modelsâ€”XGBoost, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Tree, kNN, and Gradient Boostingâ€”for anomaly detection in Modbus TCP/IP traffic.

The models are tested in both default and Genetic Algorithm (GA)-optimized configurations using a dataset of 21,384 network packets with 12 features. Key preprocessing steps include handling noisy values, feature selection with Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE), class balancing with SMOTE, and feature scaling. The GA-optimized Gradient Boosting model achieved the best performance: Accuracy 90%, Precision 88%, Recall 92%, F1-Score 90%, and ROC AUC 98%.
