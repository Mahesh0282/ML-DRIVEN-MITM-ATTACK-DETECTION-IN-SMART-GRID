# ML-DRIVEN-MITM-ATTACK-DETECTION-IN-SMART-GRID
üîê ML-Driven MITM Attack Detection in Smart Grid
This repository contains the implementation of a Machine Learning (ML)-based Intrusion Detection System (IDS) for detecting Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks in Smart Grid systems, specifically in Modbus TCP/IP environments. The project leverages various ML models, with performance boosted using Genetic Algorithm (GA) optimization.

üß† Project Objective
Detect MITM (Man-in-the-Middle) attacks using various machine learning models.

Enhance model performance using Evolutionary Algorithms (Genetic Algorithm).

Evaluate and identify the best-performing model for deployment.

üóÇ Dataset
The dataset used in this project (modbus_dataset.xlsx) is based on Modbus TCP/IP traffic data. It contains:
